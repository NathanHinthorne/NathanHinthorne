# üëã Hi, I'm Nathan Hinthorne

## üí≠ My Philosophy

I believe that code is a form of creative expression‚Äîeach project tells a story about problem-solving approaches and thought processes. My repositories aren't just collections of code; they're narratives of challenges encountered, solutions designed, and lessons learned along the way.

> "Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability." ‚Äî Edsger W. Dijkstra, pioneer in computer science

## üë®üèª‚Äçüíª About me

Recent graduate from the University of Washington with a B.S. in Computer Science and Systems and a minor in mathematics. I'm passionate about:

- **AI/ML**: Exploring how machines can learn patterns and make predictions
- **Full-Stack Development**: Building bridges between users and data through intuitive interfaces
- **Game Development**: Creating interactive experiences that engage and challenge

## üß† How I Approach Problems

1. **Understand deeply before coding**: I believe in spending time understanding the problem space thoroughly before writing a single line of code.
2. **Think in systems**: I approach projects by considering how components interact rather than just their individual functionality.
3. **Iterate with purpose**: Each iteration should address specific insights from previous versions.
4. **Balance innovation with pragmatism**: I explore creative solutions while keeping practical constraints in mind.

## üîç Current Exploration

My current focus is [Birding Pal](https://github.com/NathanHinthorne/bird-identifier-app) ‚Äì an AI-enhanced bird journaling app that represents my journey in:
- Applying machine learning to real-world classification problems
- Designing intuitive interfaces for complex functionality
- Finding the balance between educational content and gamified learning
- Creating systems that enhance appreciation for the natural world

## üíº Professional Journey & Learning

### Research Assistant | SmartCity Project, University of Washington Tacoma
üìÖ Dec 2024 - Mar 2025

My work here reflects my interest in applying AI to practical urban challenges:
- Explored the balance between computational efficiency and accuracy in road crack detection models
- Discovered how combining different feature extraction methods could enhance segmentation results
- Learned that effective research communication is just as important as technical implementation

### Software Developer Intern | Dimension XR
üìÖ June 2023 - Oct 2023
üîó [Portfolio Details](https://sites.google.com/view/nathan-hinthorne)

This experience taught me about:
- Bridging educational content with cutting-edge technology through VR
- Managing complexity in interactive systems
- The importance of user-centered design in immersive experiences

## üî¨ Projects & Thought Processes

### [Vanilla JS Web Game](https://github.com/GoodBadChad/good-bad-chad-br)
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5fbd2770-f135-4141-8a99-fb0be39f7e52" alt="game image" width="300">

**The Challenge**: Create an engaging browser game with limited frameworks

**My Approach**:
- Explored fundamental game architecture principles without library abstractions
- Practiced clean separation of concerns in vanilla JS
- Balanced creative freedom with technical constraints
- Found that cross-functional collaboration enhances both technical implementation and creative direction

### [Wave Function Collapse Algorithm Visualizer](https://nathanhinthorne.github.io/Wave-Function-Collapse-p5js/)
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/069eb347-c3c6-4c80-9a3e-38b3ddf1e5f8" alt="demo image" width="300">

**The Challenge**: Implement and visualize a complex algorithmic concept

**My Thought Process**:
- Deconstructed a complex algorithm into comprehensible components
- Used visualization as both a debugging tool and learning aid
- Applied concepts from seemingly unrelated fields (quantum mechanics and information theory) to computational problems
- Discovered that choosing which constraints should exist in a system is a foundational aspect of algorithm design.

### [Goose Browser Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/eejfnccgoejgidifcgpphjjfodmiofkm?utm_source=item-share-cb)
**The Challenge**: Create something lighthearted yet technically sound

**My Approach**:
- Explored how subtle interactions can create memorable user experiences
- Balanced humor with non-intrusiveness
- Used this project to understand browser extension architecture
- Learned that sometimes the simplest ideas can resonate most widely (2,000+ users!)

### [Dungeon Adventure Game](https://github.com/NathanHinthorne/Fallen-Champions)
| Title Screen | Intro | Gameplay |
|---------|---------|---------|
| ![Image 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aac65a27-702e-45f3-9b40-74b1c6966536) | ![Image 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42381e2e-7132-461c-abd4-a871cb9a1479) | ![Image 3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ade5c023-0455-445b-899a-9f8e7bffe51b) |

**The Challenge**: Lead development of a complete game with proper software engineering practices

**My Process**:
- Translated abstract game concepts into concrete UML diagrams
- Applied SDLC principles to game development
- Found that formal documentation improves creative implementation
- Discovered that even small teams benefit from structured development approaches

## üèÜ Academic Journey
- **GPA: 3.92**
- **2023-2025 Dean's List**
- **AT&T Technology Certificate**:
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4655a68a-793d-43e6-beca-c9da17a7be9d" alt="at-t-2024-technology-academy" width="200">
- **Google 5-day Gen AI Intensive Certificate**
<img src="" alt="google-ai-certificate" width="200">

These achievements reflect my belief that theoretical understanding and practical application should go hand-in-hand.

## üöÄ What I'm Learning Next

I'm currently exploring:
- LLM API integration in domain-specific applications, including  synthetic data generation for CNN training.
