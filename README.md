# I'm Nathan Hinthorne

## Intro 

Below you can find some of my featured repositories. Each one was a labor of love, whether it was a personal project or sparked by an assignment at my university. They're demonstrations of challenges encountered, solutions designed, and lessons learned along the way.

## 👨🏻‍💻 About me

Recent graduate from the University of Washington with a B.S. in Computer Science and Systems and a minor in Mathematics. I'm passionate about:

- **AI/ML**: Exploring how machines can learn patterns and make predictions
- **Full-Stack Development**: Building bridges between users and data through intuitive interfaces
- **Game Development**: Creating interactive experiences that engage and challenge

## 🧠 How I Approach Problems

1. **Understand deeply before coding**: I believe in spending time understanding the problem space thoroughly before writing a single line of code.
2. **Think in systems**: I approach projects by considering how components interact rather than just their individual functionality.
3. **Iterate with purpose**: Each iteration should address specific insights from previous versions.
4. **Balance innovation with pragmatism**: I explore creative solutions while keeping practical constraints in mind.

## 🔍 Current Exploration

My current focus is [Birding Pal](https://github.com/NathanHinthorne/bird-identifier-app) – an AI-enhanced bird journaling app that represents my journey in:
- Applying machine learning to real-world classification problems
- Designing intuitive interfaces for complex functionality
- Finding the balance between educational content and gamified learning
- Creating systems that enhance appreciation for the natural world

</kbd>

**The Challenge**: Create an engaging browser game with limited frameworks

**My Approach**:
-	Collaborated with a team of three to develop a 2D platformer game with action/adventure elements using vanilla JavaScript.
-	Implemented physics, advanced player movement, unique projectile behaviors, and particle effects.
-	Designed completely custom music and artwork with teammates.
- Found that cross-functional collaboration enhances both technical implementation and creative direction

### [Wave Function Collapse Algorithm Visualizer](https://nathanhinthorne.github.io/Wave-Function-Collapse-p5js/)

</kbd>

**The Challenge**: Implement and visualize a complex algorithmic concept

**My Approach**:
- Deconstructed a complex algorithm into comprehensible components
- Conducted performance analysis on different implementations of the algorithm using Python, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the terrain generation.
- Discovered that choosing which constraints should exist in a system is a foundational aspect of algorithm design.

### [Goose Browser Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/annoying-goose/eejfnccgoejgidifcgpphjjfodmiofkm)

</kbd>


**The Challenge**: Create something lighthearted yet technically sound

**My Approach**:
- Explored how subtle interactions can create memorable user experiences
- Balanced humor with non-intrusiveness
- Used this project to understand browser extension architecture
- Learned that sometimes the simplest ideas can resonate most widely (4,000+ users!)

### [Dungeon Adventure Game](https://github.com/NathanHinthorne/Fallen-Champions)
| Title Screen | Intro | Gameplay |
|---------|---------|---------|
| ![Image 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aac65a27-702e-45f3-9b40-74b1c6966536) | ![Image 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42381e2e-7132-461c-abd4-a871cb9a1479) | ![Image 3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ade5c023-0455-445b-899a-9f8e7bffe51b) |

**The Challenge**: Lead development of a complete game with proper software engineering practices

**My Process**:
- Translated abstract game concepts into concrete UML diagrams
- Applied SDLC principles to game development
- Found that formal documentation improves creative implementation
- Discovered that even small teams benefit from structured development approaches

### [Discord Story Bot](https://github.com/NathanHinthorne/discord-storybot)

**The Challenge**: Create an engaging community-building tool that encourages creative interaction to serve an online community that was lacking in this regard.

**My Approach**:
- Developed a Discord bot that facilitates collaborative storytelling using Python and discord.py
- Integrated Gemini API to generate AI-assisted plot twists and story summaries
- Implemented cloud-based persistence with Firebase Firestore to maintain story continuity
- Designed a system for story export and sharing via Google Docs API
- Learned that acting immediately to fill in gaps leads to practical, need-driven products.
- Successfully deployed to cloud infrastructure serving 3+ Discord communities

## 🚀 What I'm Learning Next

I'm currently exploring:
- LLM API integration in domain-specific applications, including  synthetic data generation for CNN training.
- Algorithm design and analysis on sites like LeetCode
- Design patterns for more maintainable code

## 🔌 Let's Connect and Exchange Ideas

I believe that the best solutions come from diverse perspectives and collaborative thinking.
